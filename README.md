This repository contains a reference implementation of our Multi-Pointer Co-Attention Networks (MPCN) proposed in KDD 2018.

Preprint is available here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09251

Note: This is a preliminary rough sketch of the MPCN implementation. The main functions are already in this repository. The next update will including running instructions and dataset prep. Since this is mainly copied from another repository, some dependencies might be broken (for now). I plan to test this repo in isolation soon. Stay tuned.

## Environment Setup

Tensorflow 1.7
Python 2.7
